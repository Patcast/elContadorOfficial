# Android App "elContador"

This is a native android app. That has been developed to help users to transition from keeping fininces data on paper to an app.  Particulary the app is designed for a real state company. Its objective is helping the company to keep track of its future and present cash flow and the status of its real state assets. Also, the mobile app must be accessible for employees with no higher education. At the moment we are working towards the 2nd Beta version.
